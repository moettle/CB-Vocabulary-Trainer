# CB-Vocabulary-Trainer
This project is a very simple vocabulary trainer inspired by the Podcast Coffee Break Spanish. Currently only Spanish-German is supported but I will add Spanish-English soon. Furthermore, the dictionary will grow in size as I listen to more episodes.

Start learning spanish by executing the python file:

```
$ python3 learn_spanish.py
```


I also recommend listening to the podcast, which is awesome for learning spanish:
